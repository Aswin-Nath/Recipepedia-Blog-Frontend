# ✅ Recipepedia Blog — Production-Readiness Checklist

This checklist covers everything needed to take the Recipepedia Blog project from a functional prototype to a production-ready, user-facing application.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- [ ] Implement **Refresh Token** flow with access/refresh tokens
- [ ] Store refresh token in **HttpOnly**, **SameSite=Strict**, **Secure** cookie
- [ ] Sanitize blog/comment content using **DOMPurify** (or backend escaping)
- [ ] Add **CSRF protection** (`csurf` middleware if using cookies)
- [ ] Use **input validation** via `express-validator` or `Joi` on all APIs
- [ ] Enforce password strength (min 8 chars, uppercase, symbols, etc.)

---

## 📚 API & Backend Improvements

- [ ] Abstract Axios calls into a **central `axiosInstance`**
- [ ] Modularize backend: move logic into `services/`, `validators/`, `controllers/`
- [ ] Add **pagination** to:
  - [ ] Blog listing
  - [ ] Bookmarks
  - [ ] Comments
- [ ] Offload media uploads to **Cloudinary** or **Amazon S3**
- [ ] Add backend **response schemas** for consistency

---

## 🧪 Testing & Stability

- [ ] Setup **Jest + Supertest** for backend testing
- [ ] Setup **React Testing Library** for frontend component testing
- [ ] Add **centralized error handler** middleware in backend
- [ ] Add **Error Boundaries** in React for UI crash safety
- [ ] Create **404 and fallback** error pages

---

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

- [ ] Add **Dockerfile** for backend and frontend
- [ ] Provide `.env.example` files
- [ ] Setup **GitHub Actions** CI:
  - [ ] Run backend tests
  - [ ] Run frontend lint/tests
  - [ ] Deploy to Render/Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Properly configure **CORS** for production

---

## 🛠️ Admin & Moderation Tools

- [ ] Add ability to **ban/suspend users**
- [ ] Maintain **audit logs** for deletions/moderation actions
- [ ] Display **report resolution history** for super-admin
